# Python_OBD_HUD
A fork of Tinkernut's code from https://www.hackster.io/tinkernut/raspberry-pi-smart-car-8641ca

Originally for a RaspberryPi and a bluetooth OBD2 but should work on any machine that can
run python and connecto to an OBD2 device I still have it as a test program since I don't
have all the hardware to test it properly
